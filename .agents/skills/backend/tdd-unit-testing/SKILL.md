# TDD & Unit Testing

## When to use this skill

- Implement new features (write test first)
- Add test coverage for code changes
- Test business logic such as handlers, services, and repositories.
- Ensure error paths and edge cases are covered

## Key principles

1. **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing test → implement → refactor
2. **Mock dependencies**: Use testify/mock to isolate units and put all mocks in a separate `mocks.go` file under a `tests` folder within the package being tested
3. **Table-driven tests**: Use `tt` patterns for multiple cases, keep tests focused and small with one behavior per test case and test success and error paths.
4. **Descriptive names**: `TestTodoService_CreateTodo` and all the scenarios and logic should be tested as individual test cases using the table driven approach
5. **Temporary variables**: Utilise the `new()` function in Go 1.26+ to initialise reference type values instead of creating pointer functions that return a reference type. For example, use `new("user-1")` instead of a function such as `ptrString("user-1")` that returns `*string` to create a pointer to a string value. This also includes all other reference types such as `new(10)` for `*int`, `new(true)` for `*bool`, etc.
6. **Assert mock expectations**: Always call `AssertExpectations(t)` at the end of tests that use mocks to ensure all expected calls were made.
7. **Helpers and test harnesses**: Always utilise any test helpers and utils from the `internals` folder as it contains helpers and utils for tests. If a helper function or util is needed then see whether it is something that is global and can be used across the codebase but if it is specific to a plugin, then keep it local to the plugin by putting the helpers and utils within the plugin's `tests` folder. Never write test code differently in each handler, service, or repository test file. Always follow the same patterns and principles to ensure consistency and maintainability across all tests.

## Testing strategy

**Handlers**: Create handler struct with UseCase/Service field; return `http.HandlerFunc` from `Handler()` method; test via httptest
**Services**: Mock repositories; test business logic and error handling
**Repositories**: Test against real SQLite database (Bun ORM); use test fixtures to set up schema
**Integration tests**: Use fixtures; test plugin routes end-to-end

## Pattern

Every test follows Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA):

1. **Arrange**: Create mocks, set expectations, prepare test data
2. **Act**: Call the function under test
3. **Assert**: Verify results and confirm all mock expectations were met

## Example files

See [examples/](examples/) for Todos testing patterns:

- `test_helpers.go` - MockTodoUseCase and MockTodoService interfaces
- `handler_test.go` - Handler struct with UseCase, Handler() method, httptest patterns
- `repository_test.go` - Real SQLite database tests with test fixtures, CRUD operations
- `todo_service_test.go` - Service tests with mocked repositories and table-driven tests
- `plugin_integration_test.go` - End-to-end route testing with fixtures

## Common mistakes

1. Not writing test first (Red-Green-Refactor discipline)
2. Testing multiple behaviors in one test
3. Using real database instead of mocks
4. Skipping error cases and edge cases
5. Not asserting mock expectations with `AssertExpectations(t)`
6. Tests that break on harmless refactoring

## Quick commands

```bash
make test                  # Run all tests
make coverage              # With coverage
go test -run TestFunc ...  # Specific test
go test -race ./...        # Detect race conditions
```
