# Services & Interface Design

## When to use this skill

- Create services that encapsulate business logic
- Implement business operations that delegate to repositories for data access (Database)
- Add authentication or domain-specific features as services

## Key principles

1. **Concrete struct design**: Services are defined as interfaces and implemented by concrete structs with the same name lowercase and with a constructor (e.g., `TodoService` and `todoService` with `NewTodoService` constructor)
2. **Constructor-based injection**: Dependencies passed at construction
3. **Single responsibility**: Each service handles one domain concern
4. **Repository delegation**: Services delegate all data access to repositories
5. **Context-aware**: All public methods accept `context.Context`
6. **Interface return types**: Constructors return interfaces, not concrete types
7. **Single File Exports**: Each service implementation is in its own file. However, all service interfaces are exported from `interfaces.go` under the `services/` folder.

## Pattern

Services handle business logic:

- Define interface for service with methods representing business operations
- Implement as concrete struct with repository dependencies
- Constructor function injects all dependencies
- Methods are thin wrappers that validate, transform, and delegate to repositories
- Return interfaces from constructors

## Example

See [examples/todo_service.go](examples/todo_service.go) for:

- TodoService interface definition
- todoService implementation with constructor
- Validation and repository delegation patterns

## Common mistakes

1. Service-to-service direct calls without interfaces
2. Putting queries in services (repositories own data access)
3. Missing context parameter
4. Exporting implementation struct instead of interface
5. Not testing with mocks
